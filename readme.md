# Super-Wicked-Engine

### Disclaimer 
This project is based on this [Game Engine series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlrATfBNZ98dC-V-N3m0Go4deliWHPFwT) 
by [The Cherno](https://www.youtube.com/@TheCherno). I have followed and written it all by hand (not copied and pasted) but 
followed his guidance and teachings.

This is a learning project for me to learn about c++ and building game engines.
